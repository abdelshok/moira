Moira is a chat application for the terminal.

It's the first prototype. Some specs might change, the details are still being worked on.

Moira references the name Moirai, referencing the three mythological creatures.

Users will be able to create group chats through 'channels', set passwords or not for said channels, message each other back and forth in real time. Messages will be implemented with E2EE to preserve maximum privacy and aren't saved on any of the cloud servers.

I'm separating the servers and using different providers to make sure that the data isn't centralized anywhere.

Hopefully this will allow some people to have some fun while at work :)
