Moira is a chat application for the terminal.

This is my first prototype. 

The application should allow users to type in a room number, which would represent a chat room, and then join it, in order to talk and interact with colleagues, friends, enemies, whomever.

The application will be encrypted from end to end, and chat conversations will be cleared out and not be saved, to ensure maximum privacy.

Some specs might change, the details are still being worked on.

Moira references the name Moirai, which is that of the three Greek mythological creatures called the Fates. Atropos, Lachesis,and Clotho. 

Hopefully this will provide people with a sense of privacy. Also,honestly it'll also give people the impression that you're actually working, so hopefully other software engineers will enjoy this one.
