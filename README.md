Moira is a chat application for the terminal.

It's the first prototype. Some specs might change, the details are still being worked on.

Moira references the name Moirai, which is that of the three Greek mythological creatures called the Fates. Atropos, Lachesis,and Clotho. 

Why did I create it? A few reasons.

Moira does not track messages. Although it uses Firebase for authentication, it does actually not track the messages being sent across the server. If users leave the chat, they do not have access to the conversation history. Privacy is always good. 

Added benefit is also that you get to pretend to be working when you're not necessarily.
