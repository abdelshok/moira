Moira is a chat application for the terminal.

First prototype. 

The application will be encrypted from end to end, chat conversations will be cleared out and not be saved, to ensure maximum privacy.

Some specs might change, the details are still being worked on.

Moira references the name Moirai, which is that of the three Greek mythological creatures called the Fates. Atropos, Lachesis,and Clotho. 

It'll give people the impression that you're actually working when you're not, so hopefully other software engineers will enjoy this one.
